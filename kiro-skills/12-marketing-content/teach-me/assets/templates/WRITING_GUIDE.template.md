# Writing Guide — Learning {{TOPIC}}

This file is the shared brief for every chapter writer. **Read all of it before you write a word.** The consistency-pass agent uses these same rules to validate and patch your chapter.

## Analogy bank — domains the learner already knows

{{KNOWN_DOMAINS}}

**When you introduce a new abstract concept**, scan this list. If one domain shares relational structure with the concept, build an analogy from it. Use the format:

```markdown
> **Analogy**: <one-paragraph analogy mapped to a known domain>
>
> **Where this breaks down**: <one or two specific disanalogies>
```

If no domain in the bank fits cleanly, **skip the analogy**. A bad analogy is worse than no analogy — it teaches the wrong relational structure (Gentner 1983).

## Component library

The viewer ships a curated component library. **Read `<skill-dir>/assets/COMPONENTS.md` for the full reference** before writing your chapter. Quick highlights:

- **Callouts**: use `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!INSIGHT]`, `> [!ANALOGY]`, `> [!BREAKDOWN]`, `> [!QUOTE]`, `> [!HISTORY]` — all auto-styled. The legacy `> **Self-explain**:`, `> **Analogy**:`, `> **Where this breaks down**:` patterns are also auto-detected and styled — keep using them.
- **Diagram cards**: any `![alt](./diagrams/...)` followed optionally by an italic `*caption*` line is auto-wrapped in a light-backgrounded card that reads well in both themes. **Just write plain markdown** — no `<figure>` needed.
- **Compare**: `<div class="compare">` with two `<aside class="compare-bad">` / `<aside class="compare-good">` columns for Do/Don't or Before/After.
- **Tabs**: `<div class="tabs">` with `<nav class="tab-nav">` buttons and `<div class="tab-panel" data-content="...">` panels — use for showing the same concept across multiple platforms.
- **Stat card**: `<aside class="stat"><strong>50,000</strong><span>events limit</span></aside>` for numeric highlights.
- **Platform pill**: `<span class="platform-pill" data-platform="temporal">Temporal</span>` — color-coded chips for `temporal`, `trigger`, `inngest`, `restate`, `step-functions`, `dbos`.
- **Step list**: `<ol class="step-list">` for procedures with prominent number badges.

Prefer auto-styled callouts over plain blockquotes when you're flagging information. The components are theme-aware and visually consistent across the course.

## The non-negotiable rules

### 1. Concrete before abstract

The **first sentence** of every chapter names a concrete observable instance. No abstract noun in that first sentence until a concrete instance has been shown.

- ❌ "Classification is the task of assigning a label from a discrete set to an input."
- ✅ "A spam filter looks at every email in your inbox and decides: junk or not junk."

### 2. Cards, not essays

Each chapter is **5–9 cards**, separated by `---` (a horizontal rule on its own line).

- Each card: **250–500 words**, **one concept**, **one diagram** (if the concept is relational), one self-explanation prompt.
- A card >600 words without a diagram is a defect — find what should have been visualized.

### 3. Diagram-first for relational concepts

If a concept involves flow, hierarchy, state transitions, sequencing, comparison, architecture, or 3+ related entities → **diagram is mandatory**, not optional.

Diagrams support text. Text fills the gaps the diagram can't carry (the *why*, the gotchas, the trade-offs).

**No decorative imagery.** Every diagram must encode a proposition that's actually claimed in the surrounding prose. If you can't say what *information* the diagram adds beyond the words, delete it.

### 4. Diagram conventions

- **Contrast is non-negotiable.** Every diagram renders on a light-backgrounded card that stays light in BOTH light and dark themes:
  - Top-level diagrams auto-wrap in `.diagram-card` (light bg, dark strokes).
  - Diagrams inside a `.state-step` get the same light-card treatment applied directly to the `<img>` / `<svg>`.
  - Diagrams inside callouts inherit the callout's surface — if the strokes would clash, wrap the diagram in `<figure class="diagram-card">` explicitly.

  Your strokes and text MUST use the dark color `#1f2937` so they read against the light card. **Never use `currentColor` for strokes/text in diagrams** — it would invert badly in dark mode.

  **Quick contrast check** before submitting: imagine the page in dark mode. If the diagram is rendering against `#1e293b` (the dark surface) instead of a near-white card, the dark strokes vanish. Use `<img>` / `<svg>` only inside elements that have light-card CSS applied; otherwise wrap explicitly in `<figure class="diagram-card">`.
- ViewBox: `0 0 800 480` (or smaller — never larger)
- Colors (4-color palette only — these are fixed hex values, not CSS variables):
  - `#1f2937` — text and strokes (dark slate; reads on the light diagram card in both themes)
  - `#3b82f6` — primary fill (blue)
  - `#f59e0b` — accent (amber)
  - `#10b981` — positive/success (emerald)
- Font: `system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`, 14–18px (bigger is fine if there's room)
- Strokes: 1.5px or 2px (1px reads too faint inside the card)
- Padding: ≥24px around any text label so they don't crowd the card's edge
- **Labels are inline annotations on the diagram, not in a separate legend block.** No `## Legend` headers anywhere.
- **Backgrounds** inside the SVG: if you need a fill, use a tinted version of the palette (e.g. `#3b82f615` for a 8%-alpha primary). Never use pure white as a fill — it disappears against the card.
- Caption: every diagram has a one-sentence caption directly below the image as `*italic*` — the build script auto-wraps it into a `<figcaption>`.
- Opt-in interactivity: add `data-interactive="hover-explain"` on the root `<svg>` and `data-explain="<text>"` attrs on labeled elements to enable tooltips in the HTML viewer.

Files go in `./diagrams/chNN-<short-name>.svg`. Referenced from chapter as `![alt](./diagrams/chNN-<name>.svg)`.

### 5. Analogy hygiene

Every analogy must be followed within 2 paragraphs by an explicit "where this breaks down" disclaimer naming at least one disanalogy.

This rule catches phrases like "is like a", "think of … as", "imagine X as a Y", "**Analogy**:". The consistency-pass agent flags these and rejects chapters that don't have a disclaimer.

### 6. Jargon gate

Every technical term gets a definition in the same paragraph on first use OR links to a glossary entry from an earlier chapter (`[term](#term-slug)` or similar). **No exceptions for terms you consider "common"** — the learner might not.

In the chapter frontmatter `introduces.terms`, list every term you define. Future chapters will check this ledger before redefining.

### 7. B1 sentence discipline

- Mean sentence length **≤18 words**, max **25**.
- **≤1 subordinate clause per sentence.**
- **Passive voice ≤10%** of sentences. Default to active voice.
- Address the reader as **"you"**. We are a partner, not a textbook.
- **No idioms**, no cultural metaphors. Banned phrases include: "low-hanging fruit", "moving the needle", "on the same page", "down the rabbit hole", "boil the ocean", "the elephant in the room", "back to square one", "ahead of the curve". Use literal language.
- Prefer Anglo-Saxon over Latinate verbs: "use" not "utilize", "show" not "demonstrate", "help" not "facilitate".
- Avoid noun-stacking: not "user data access policy" — write "the policy for accessing user data".

### 8. No filler

Banned: "It's important to note that…", "In conclusion…", "This is a great way to…", "It is worth mentioning…", "At the end of the day…", "Needless to say…", "Without further ado…".

Just say the thing.

### 9. Retrieval and recap at end of every chapter

Every chapter ends with:

```markdown
## Recall (before scrolling away)

<details><summary>1. <free-recall question>?</summary>
<short answer>
</details>

<details><summary>2. <free-recall question>?</summary>
<short answer>
</details>

<details><summary>3. <free-recall question>?</summary>
<short answer>
</details>

<details><summary>4. Callback: <question about a concept from 2 chapters back, by name>?</summary>
<short answer>
</details>

## Recap
- <mirror of "What you'll learn" bullets, now stated as facts>

## Next
<one sentence pointing to the next chapter>
```

Free recall / short answer prompts only. **No multiple choice** — too easy to recognize without retrieving.

### 10. Self-explanation prompts between cards

After the main body of each card (before the next card divider), add:

```markdown
> **Self-explain**: Finish this sentence — "<concept> works because ___"
>
> <details><summary>Sample answer</summary>
> <model explanation in 1–2 sentences — concrete, not abstract>
> </details>
```

Constrained prompts (sentence-completion) beat open prompts ("explain this") for low-prior-knowledge readers.

### 11. Code blocks (technical topics only)

If the topic is technical:

- Language is **{{CANONICAL_LANGUAGE}}** unless the user's scope said otherwise.
- Every block has a **one-line code comment above** (what it does in code terms).
- Every block has a **one-line plain-English explanation below** (what it does for the reader).
- Code must be **runnable / copy-pasteable**. No abstract pseudocode.

Example:
```markdown
```ts
// Start a workflow and wait for its result.
const handle = await client.workflow.start(myWorkflow, { args: ['order-123'] });
const result = await handle.result();
```
This kicks off `myWorkflow` with one argument and waits until it finishes before continuing.
```

### 12. Show state changes; don't narrate them

**Default to a state-sequence diagram whenever you'd otherwise narrate evolution over time.** Prose forces the reader to *rebuild* the state in their head from a sequential parse (Larkin & Simon 1987). A diagram shows the state directly. By the time the reader reaches the third sentence of a state walkthrough, the contents of the first state have already faded from working memory (Sweller's transient-information effect — Wong et al. 2012).

❌ Bad — narrating evolution in prose:

> Suppose the server crashes after `sendWelcomeEmail` returns and the timer is set. The event history now holds: Started, Activity scheduled, Result: `em_1`, Timer set: wake at 03:00. When a new worker picks the workflow up, it runs `welcomeFlow` from line 1 again. But each `await activity.…` does not actually call the email service. Instead, the engine intercepts the call and asks: "Is there already a result for this in the event history?" Yes — `em_1`. So the await resolves with `em_1`. No network call.

✅ Good — 3 labeled panels showing each state (small multiples, Tufte):

```html
<div class="state-sequence">
  <figure class="state-step">
    <p class="state-step-label">Before the crash</p>
    <img src="./diagrams/chNN-state-1.svg" alt="...">
    <figcaption>Server crashes. Event history is durable; worker memory is gone.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="state-step">
    <p class="state-step-label">Replay begins</p>
    <img src="./diagrams/chNN-state-2.svg" alt="...">
    <figcaption>New worker re-runs the code; each await reads the history first.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="state-step">
    <p class="state-step-label">After replay</p>
    <img src="./diagrams/chNN-state-3.svg" alt="...">
    <figcaption>State reconstructed without re-sending the email.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
```

**Trigger detection** — when a paragraph hits any of these, stop writing prose and convert to a state-sequence:

- **Temporal-marker density** — 3+ of: "first", "then", "now", "after", "before", "finally", "next", "once", "when", "suppose".
- **State-update verbs** — `the <noun> (now|then) <verb-past>` or `the <noun> is now <state>` or `the <noun> holds: <list>`.
- **Enumerated event lists in prose** — 3+ comma-separated event tokens (`Started, Activity scheduled, Result: …, Timer set: …`). That list is a table; render it as one.
- **Hypothetical thought-experiments** — "Suppose X. Then Y. Then Z." — these are step-by-step thought experiments. Storyboard them.
- **Pronoun-state drift** — 3+ sentences in a row whose subject is the same entity behaving at successive moments (`the worker… the worker… it…`).
- **State-change verb clusters** with no nearby figure — `crashes / replays / resumes / retries / restarts / fails over / rolls back / commits / reconciles` appear and the nearest figure is more than ~200 words away.

**Rules** (from Tufte's small multiples + Tversky & Morrison's Apprehension Principle + the dual-coding / segmenting / transient-information research):

1. **State sequences are panels, not paragraphs.** If you can write "Step 1: … Step 2: … Step 3: …" about observable state, render one labeled panel per step.
2. **Small-multiples discipline — same shape in every panel.** Use identical layout, columns, axes, and visual encoding across the sequence. The eye diffs pre-attentively. Reformatting between panels destroys that.
3. **Persist, don't transit.** Static side-by-side panels beat animation. If you must animate, require pause/scrub controls. For novices, default to static (Tversky & Morrison 2002; Sweller transient-information).
4. **Annotate the delta.** In each panel after the first, highlight what changed — new row, modified value, moved pointer, struck-out entry. The delta is the lesson; the rest is anchor context.
5. **Caption = trigger + invariant.** Each panel's caption names what *caused* the transition AND what stays true ("Server crashes; event history is durable"). This is where prose belongs — anchoring the diagram, not replacing it.
6. **2–5 panels.** Fewer than 2 isn't a sequence; more than 5 exceeds working-memory comparison budget (~4 elements; Cowan 2001). Split into two figures if you need more.
7. **Show the actual data structure**, not a metaphor. A box labeled "history" with no contents shown forces the reader to remember; defeats the point. End at the real shape (concreteness fading, Fyfe et al. 2014).
8. **No "after" without "before".** A single post-state panel forces the reader to reconstruct the prior state in prose. Always show the starting point.

**What NOT to do**:

- Decorative cartooning that hides the actual state behind a mascot.
- Animation without pause/scrub controls (Apprehension Principle).
- Reformatting columns or fields between panels.
- Prose that re-narrates exactly what the panels show — that's double cognitive load, not dual coding. Prose should add the causal / invariant layer.
- More than ~5 panels — split.

**Research basis**:

- Tversky & Morrison, ["Animation: can it facilitate?"](https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs448b/papers/Tversky_AnimationFacilitate_IJHCS02.pdf), *IJHCS* 2002 — the Apprehension Principle; equated-information static graphics ≥ animation.

### 13. Write like a human, not a thesis

The reader is a person scrolling. Make the text easy on the eyes.

**Be digestible.**

- Short paragraphs. 1 to 3 sentences each, then a blank line.
- No walls of text. If a paragraph runs longer than 4 lines on screen, split it.
- Break concepts down. One idea per paragraph. One paragraph per beat.
- Lists are fine when there really is a list. Do not turn every paragraph into bullets.

**Plain glyphs only.**

- Use ASCII and simple Latin script. Write as a person types on a normal keyboard.
- Allowed punctuation: regular hyphen `-`, comma, period, colon, semicolon, parentheses, quotes, exclamation, question mark.
- No fancy separators. Banned glyphs include `x` used as a multiplier between things (write the word `by`), bullet glyphs in prose, decorative arrows in body text.

**Keep markdown light.**

- Lists, code blocks, inline code, and links are fine.
- Do not bold every other phrase. Bold is for the one term that matters in the paragraph, not for emphasis sprayed across the page.
- Bold headings are only for actual headings (the `##` and `###` lines). Do not turn paragraphs into `**Title**:` mini-headings on every block.
- Legibility wins over structure. If a section looks like a checklist of bold labels, flatten it into prose.

**Forbidden syntactic and grammatical constructs. Never use these.**

1. **No em-dash and no en-dash.** The characters `—` (U+2014) and `–` (U+2013) are banned everywhere in chapter prose, captions, summaries, and recall answers. Break the sentence into two sentences, use a comma, use parentheses, or restructure.

   Bad: `Replay is fast - the engine just reads the history.`
   (with an em-dash there)

   Good: `Replay is fast. The engine just reads the history.`

   Good: `Replay is fast (the engine just reads the history).`

2. **No glyph separators.** Do not use `x` as a separator like `before x after`, do not use middle dots, do not use heavy bullets in running text. Words and ordinary punctuation only.

3. **No "It is not X: it is Y." construction.** Same for "It's not X, it's Y" and its variants. State what the thing is. The reader does not need the negation first.

   Bad: `Replay is not magic: it is bookkeeping.`

   Good: `Replay is bookkeeping. The engine reads the event history and skips the work it has already recorded.`

4. **No "Not just X, but Y" tricolon.** Same family of construction. Drop the contrast frame and write the actual point.

   Bad: `Not just durable, but replayable.`

   Good: `Workflows are replayable. The engine reconstructs state from the event history.`

5. **No "Key insight", "The key insight", "Key takeaway", "Pro tip", "Bottom line", "TL;DR", or any phrase that announces that an insight is coming.** State the insight. The reader can tell it is important because it is in the chapter.

   Bad: `Key insight: the worker has no memory between replays.`

   Good: `The worker has no memory between replays. Every value the code needs has to come from the event history.`

If you catch yourself reaching for any of these patterns, rewrite the sentence. The patterns are easy to detect with grep; the consistency pass will flag every occurrence.

### 14. Worked examples with backward fading

Your assigned **fading stage** is given in the chapter brief. Match it:

- **`full-worked`** (early chapters, 1–3): show complete worked examples with every step annotated.
- **`backward-faded`** (middle chapters, 4 to N-2): blank the **last** step of the worked example and ask the learner to complete it. Show the answer in a `<details>` toggle. Subsequent examples blank earlier steps.
- **`prompt-only`** (last 2 chapters): pose the problem, no worked example. A "stuck?" toggle reveals a hint, not the full solution.

- `slug`: kebab-case
- `requires`: chapters and concept-slugs the reader needs first
- `introduces.concepts`: every new named concept (these become entries in `concepts.json`)
- `introduces.terms`: every term you defined for the first time (these become entries in `terms.json`)
- `callbacks`: concept-slugs from earlier chapters that you deliberately use here without redefining (this is how spaced exposure works)
- `fading-stage`: `full-worked` | `backward-faded` | `prompt-only`

## Density checks the consistency-pass will run

- Card word count between 250 and 600 → flagged if outside
- ≥1 diagram per card whose concept is relational → flagged if missing
- First sentence of chapter does not start with an abstract definitional pattern (`X is the…`, `X refers to…`, `X is defined as…`) → flagged if it does
- Mean sentence ≤18 words, max 25 → flagged if exceeded
- Every "is like a"/"think of … as"/"**Analogy**:" has a "**Where this breaks down**:" within 2 paragraphs → flagged if missing
- Every technical term in the chapter is either defined in the same paragraph on first use OR present in the term ledger from an earlier chapter → flagged if neither
- Required sections present: `## What you'll learn`, `## Prereq check`, ≥3 cards, `## Recall`, `## Recap`, `## Next` → flagged if missing
- ≥1 callback to a concept from ≥2 chapters back in the Recall section → flagged if missing
- No banned phrases or filler → flagged if found
- No em-dash `—` or en-dash `–` anywhere in the chapter (rule 13) → flagged if found
- No "It is not X, it is Y" / "It's not X: it's Y" / "Not just X, but Y" construction (rule 13) → flagged if found
- No "Key insight", "Key takeaway", "Pro tip", "Bottom line", "TL;DR" or similar insight-announcer phrases (rule 13) → flagged if found
- No paragraph longer than 4 sentences without a break, no run of 3+ bolded sub-headings inside a single card (rule 13) → flagged if found

Patch your chapter before submitting if any of these would fire.
