# Onboarding

**Official Documentation:** [Nova Act GitHub README](https://github.com/aws/nova-act/blob/main/README.md) is the source of truth.

## Step 1: Authentication Setup

Nova Act supports two authentication methods. **You MUST prompt the user for which method they want to use!**

- **API Key (Quick Start)** — Best for development/testing. Generate at https://nova.amazon.com/act?tab=dev_tools, then `export NOVA_ACT_API_KEY="your_key"`. No decorator needed.
- **AWS Credentials + Workflow Definition (Production)** — Best for IAM-based access, S3 export. Requires AWS creds + `@workflow` decorator. See `references/workflow_definitions.md`.

Full setup details: `references/authentication.md`

## Step 2: Start Using Nova Act

**Route to the right mode:**

| User wants to... | Route to |
|-------------------|----------|
| Explore a website interactively | `references/browser_cli.md` (Option A) |
| Build a coding agent with browser | `references/browser_cli.md` (Option A) |
| Write a repeatable test script | `references/qa_tests.md` (Option B) |
| Write a Python automation script | `references/qa_tests.md` (Option B) + `references/data_extraction.md` |
| Convert manual tests to automated | `references/gherkin_testing.md` |
| Understand a codebase via its UI | `references/flow_discovery.md` |
| Reproduce a bug | `references/bug_reproduction.md` |
| Iterate on / refine automation prompts | `references/workflow_refinement.md` |
| Generate mock sites from real site recordings | `references/mock_generation.md` |
| Deploy to production | `references/deployment_cli.md` |

**Option A: Browser CLI (recommended for exploration and agent tool-use)**
```bash
pip install 'nova-act[cli]'
act browser execute "Go to https://example.com, find the pricing page, and extract plan names and prices" --session-id work
# If you need to observe current state:
act browser ask "What page am I on?" --session-id work
# If you need a zero-inference jump:
act browser goto https://example.com/specific-page --session-id work
```
Default to `execute` with a detailed plan. Use individual commands (`goto`, `ask`, etc.) for recovery, observation, or zero-inference actions. Pass NovaAct constructor or method args with `--nova-arg`: e.g. `--nova-arg max_steps=5 --nova-arg headless=true`. Run any command with `--help` for all available options.

> **IMPORTANT**: Before running any browser command, ask the user whether they want headed (visible browser) or headless mode, unless they have already specified. Use `--headed` or `--headless` accordingly.

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: NEVER kill Chrome or Chromium processes** (e.g., `pkill chrome`, `kill -9 $(pgrep chrome)`, `killall Google Chrome`). Nova Act manages its own browser lifecycle. Killing browser processes externally will corrupt session state and break automation. If a browser appears stuck, use `act browser sessions` to check status, or start a new session.

> 💡 **Localhost HTTPS Testing**: When testing against a local HTTPS server (e.g., `https://localhost:8443`), Chrome will reject self-signed certificates by default. Add `--launch-arg=--ignore-certificate-errors --ignore-https-errors` to bypass this:
> ```bash
> act browser goto https://localhost:8443 --session-id dev --launch-arg=--ignore-certificate-errors --ignore-https-errors
> ```
> ⚠️ Only use `--ignore-certificate-errors` for **localhost** development servers. For non-local URLs, valid certificates should be used unless you have a specific reason to bypass validation.

**Option B: Python Script (recommended for repeatable automation)**
```python
from nova_act import NovaAct

with NovaAct(starting_page="https://example.com") as nova:
    nova.act("click the first link on the page")
    result = nova.act_get("What is the page title?")
    print(f"Page title: {result.response}")
```

## Step 3: Validate Installation
- **Python 3.10+**: `python --version`
- **Nova Act SDK**: `pip install 'nova-act[cli]'` / `pip show nova-act`
- **Google Chrome (Optional)**: `playwright install chrome`

# Steering Files

**Quickstart:** When given a URL to explore or automate, start with `references/browser_cli.md`.

| File | What It Covers |
|------|---------------|
| `references/browser_cli.md` | **Browser CLI** — commands, sessions, config, page exploration. Default for interactive work and agent tool-use. **You MUST read the ENTIRE file** — it contains critical CLI best practices, command decision guides, and example transcripts that are essential for correct usage |
| `references/qa_tests.md` | **Script writing** — QA testing with pytest/unittest, act() vs act_get(), schemas, assertion patterns |
| `references/deployment_cli.md` | **Deployment CLI** — deploy workflows to AgentCore Runtime on AWS |
| `references/authentication.md` | API key vs IAM, session management |
| `references/workflow_definitions.md` | Workflow definitions with AWS CLI |
| `references/data_extraction.md` | Structured extraction with Pydantic |
| `references/hitl.md` | Human approval and UI takeover patterns |
| `references/tool_use.md` | External tools (@tool decorator, MCP servers) |
| `references/agentcore_browser.md` | Remote browser via AgentCore |
| `references/playwright_interop.md` | Direct Playwright page access, sensitive input, file downloads |
| `references/session_logs.md` | Logs, screenshots, and video recordings |
| `references/trajectory_analysis.md` | Understanding Nova Act trajectories |
| `references/visual_reporting.md` | Visual reporting — post-session markdown reports from steps.yaml, snapshots, and screenshots |
| `references/gherkin_testing.md` | **Gherkin testing** — `.feature` file writing, `qa-plan` compilation, session export → Gherkin conversion |
| `references/flow_discovery.md` | **Flow discovery** — live app exploration → codebase mapping, developer onboarding docs |
| `references/bug_reproduction.md` | **Bug reproduction** — reproduce → capture evidence → export → regression test |
| `references/parallel_sessions.md` | **Parallel sessions** — run multiple browser sessions concurrently with subagents, chunking, session limits |
| `references/workflow_refinement.md` | **Workflow refinement** — analyze chain-of-thought, identify failure patterns, revise and validate browser automation workflows |
| `references/mock_generation.md` | **Mock generation** — generate static HTML mock sites from real site trajectories for fast, offline iteration |
